This is just a simplified representation of a webnovel API with DRF, file-based databasse, and JWT for authentication.

Users are able to sign up/log in to receive access tokens, and thereby access the rest of the endpoints. In hindsight, perhaps I should have kept a couple of those open lol. 
Anyway, we've got what you'd expect: CRUD for books, CRUD for chapters, plus users can leave/delete reviews with values ranging from 1 to 5.

That just about sums it up...enjoy!
